# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results:
1) Total Fares by City Type:
There is a greater usage of PyBer in urban cities, the total fares are consequently also higher than suburban and rural cities. PyBer transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000 whereas transactions in urban cities and rural cities totaled at least $19,000 and $4,000, respectively. The figure below demonstrates where the majority of PyBer's revenue occurred during this time period: urban cities.

2) Total Rides by City Type:
The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. The figure below highlights how rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides during this five-month period.

3) Total Drivers by City Type:
There was also a larger volume of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities. Again, the figure below depicts the significance of drivers in urban cities during this time period.

4) Average fare per ride and driver:
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. The figure below highlights how rides in Urban cities contributed the most to PyBer's overall rides during this five-month period.

There are significantly more drivers and rides in urban cities than both suburban and rural cities. Also, total urban fares outnumbers the fare totals of suburban and rural cities combined. However, the average fare per ride is lowest in urban cities. In addition, the average fare per driver is much lower in urban cities compared to rural and suburban.

# Summary:
There is a larger use of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities.
There are more drivers in urban cities than rural cities.
As a result, the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities.
On the other hand, the costs for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban cities. This could discourage potential riders from using PyBer given the high average fare per ride.
Drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. This could discourage discourage potential drivers from working with PyBer given the low average fare per driver.
There is an another opportunity for further analysis to determine other factors that are contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities. Perhaps, travel distance is a key factor.
Overall, PyBer ridersharing services significantly differs in rural, suruban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares. Data supports that there is higher usage of PyBer ridesharing services in urban cities.
There is a summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types are:
1) Drivers in Urban cities would need to be paid more to make up for the disparity in average fare per driver.
2) Fare prices could also be lowered in rural areas since the average fare per ride is higher than the othe two city types.
3) PyBer could hire more drivers in rural areas to meet the demand of a spike in customers.
